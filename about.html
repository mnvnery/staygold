        <p class="content-text">
            Stay Gold Features is a film fund and production
            company established to produce films by auteur
            directors. Inspired by the last words of The
            Outsiders’ Johnny Cade, “Stay Gold Ponyboy”.
            <br><br>
            Our mission is to stay true to the integrity and high
            quality of movies that we admire and to partner with the
            most progressive and innovative filmmakers of our time.
            Stay Gold Features will produce elevated content that
            is at once intelligent and commercial; our films will push
            boundaries by exploring the human condition, making
            audiences laugh, cry and converse.
            <br><br>
            As illustrated by historical success, Stay Gold
            will continue to work with filmmakers who have
            extraordinary vision and whose gift as storytellers sets
            their films apart from the pack.
