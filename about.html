  We are a production and financing company founded by Daniela Taplin Lundberg.
  Our name comes from Johnny Cade's last words to Ponyboy in *The Outsiders*:
  “Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold.”


  We produce projects that are sincere, smart, and widely-resonant, and we have never shied away from taking risks. As we grow beyond our roots in independent film, we will continue championing singular visions and telling untold stories.
