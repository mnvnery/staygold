  90-day rehab program while also threatening divorce. Andy takes charge of
  their nine-year-old twins, thrusting him into the world of modern parenthood
  for which he is deeply unprepared. With his career falling by the wayside,
  Andy leans on his grown and pregnant daughter Grace for support, and

  being put to the test, Andy learns the true meaning of having it all.
