synopsis: Set in contemporary Los Angeles during the holidays, the film tells the
  comedic and heart-warming story of art dealer Andy Goodrich (Keaton), a man whose
  life is upended when his younger second wife leaves him and enters a 90-day rehab
  program while also threatening divorce. Andy takes charge of their nine-year-old
  twins, thrusting him into the world of modern parenthood for which he is deeply
  unprepared. With his career falling by the wayside, Andy leans on his grown and
  pregnant daughter Grace for support, and ultimately evolves into the father Grace
  never had. With all his relationships being put to the test, Andy learns the true
  meaning of having it all.
